/*
Determine the output for each of the following when x is 9 and y is 11, and
when x is 11 and y is 9. The compiler ignores the indentation in a C program.
Also, the compiler always associates an else with the previous if unless told
to do otherwise by the placement of braces {}. Because, on first glance, you
may not be sure which if an else matches, this is referred to as the “dangling
else” problem. We eliminated the indentation from the following code to make
the problem more challenging.

[Hint: Apply indentation conventions you have learned.]
