/*
Develop a C program that will determine if a department store customer has exceeded the credit
limit on a charge account. For each customer, the following facts are available:
a) Account number
b) Balance at the beginning of the month
c) Total of all items charged by this customer this month
d) Total of all credits applied to this customer's account this month
e) Allowed credit limit
The program should input each fact, calculate the new balance
(= beginning balance + charges Ð credits), and determine whether
the new balance exceeds the customer's credit limit.
For those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the program should
display the customer's account number, credit limit, new balance and
the message ÒCredit limit exceeded.Ó Here is a sample input/output dialog:

Enter account number (-1 to end): 100
Enter beginning balance: 5394.78
Enter total charges: 1000.00
Enter total credits: 500.00
Enter credit limit: 5500.00 Account: 100
Credit limit: 5500.00 Balance: 5894.78
Credit Limit Exceeded.

Enter account number (-1 to end): 200
Enter beginning balance: 1000.00
Enter total charges: 123.45
Enter total credits: 321.00
Enter credit limit: 1500.00

Enter account number (-1 to end): 300
Enter beginning balance: 500.00
Enter total charges: 274.73
Enter total credits: 100.00
Enter credit limit: 800.00
Enter account number (-1 to end): -1
